## Description:
This is the beginning of the Front End for the Sweater Weather project.
The project intends to allow a user to search a location and see the current weather
conditions for that particular location.
This project consumes the whether-to-weather api which makes calls to the Google,
Flickr, and DarkSky Apis for location, photos, and weather.
The project will display a random user photo from the Flickr api based on the location set.

This particular project uses JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery.
